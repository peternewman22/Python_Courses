    "You might think that including tables in a course about data visualisation is a bit pointless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surely the whole point of displaying data in a visual way is to remove the need for clunky, ugly and hard-to-read tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not neccesarily true; presenting data in a table is a valid and useful way of communicating data to your audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic difference between tables and charts is that whilst charts interact with our visual system of understanding, tables interact with our verbal system - we read them, and therefore absorb information differently from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a table?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are actually a very effective form of data presentation for several reasons:\n",
    "1. Familiarity - Almost everyone is familiar with tables and how to read and understand them. \n",
    "2. Granularity - Tables can show data at the lowest level of aggregation, and allow people to interrogate the raw numbers without having to interpret them through a chart or through hoverinfo.\n",
    "3. Variety - Different people interact with data in different ways. Including a table in your dashboard will broaden its appeal to those who like seeing tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tables and charts complement each other because each serves a different function for presenting data."
